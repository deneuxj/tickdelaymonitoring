# TickDelayMonitoring #

This project includes software to monitor the so-called tick delay of a running IL-2 Sturmovik dedicated server and trigger logic in the mission when this delay exceeds 20ms.
It also includes a software tool to inject code in an existing mission to dynamically select elements (typically AI groups) to deactivate when the delay exceeds 20ms.

The software is meant to be built using Visual Studio 2015.

For instructions, run each tool from the command prompt with argument /?
